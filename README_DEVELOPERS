1) Development Process (two developers, brad and jay - other contributions will flow up to brad/jay in a branch) :

  1) Developer team finds bug or test team finds bug.
  
  A bugzilla bug is created under bugzilla.redhat.com, for the project: RedHat Storage, Component: glusterfs-hadoop
 
  2) Developer X accepts bug. 

  3) Developer X creates Branch named BZ_____ for the bug, where _____ = the ID of the bug: 

     For example: git branch $ git branch --track BZ11111 origin/master

  4) Developer X writes test for the bug, commits and pushes to branch - build should fail at this point.

  5) Developer X writes the fix for the bug, runs test locally, confirms build passes, and again pushes. 

  6) Developer Y confirms fix

  7) Developer Y merges branch BZ______ with HEAD, and in the same step , confirms that build passes on build.gluster.org

     If build fails, the merge is reverted. 

2) ECLIPSE SETUP 

  TBD
